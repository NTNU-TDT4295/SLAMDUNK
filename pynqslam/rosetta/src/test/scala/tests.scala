  /**
    Somewhat unintuitively named, a cycle task is a list test tasks at some time step.
    In order to not have to supply a list the scala varargs syntax (*) is used.
    As an example, at step 13 we want to input a value to a signal in: (PeekPokeTester[T] => Unit)
    and check an output out: ((PeekPokeTester[T] => Unit) with the possibility of test failure exception)
    Thanks to varargs syntax this would be
    CycleTask[MyModule](13, in, out)

    Sometimes it is convenient to delay a bunch of checks by some set amount of cycles.
    For instance, assume a component needs 10 cycles to set up, but it's more convenient
    to write tests from T = 0, we do that and then call .delay(10) to ensure the T0 for the
    tasks is actually T = 10
